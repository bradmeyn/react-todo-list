# React Todo

### Description

A simple todo list that allows you to save and edit tasks.

## Features

- Create, edit, complete and delete tasks.
- View completed tasks in seperated dated list.

## Software Used

- React
- CSS
- UUID for list ids
- Github Pages for Hosting

## Techniques Demonstrated

- Initially built with React class-based components
- Re-configured to use React functional components w/ hooks (useState & useEffect).
- Conditional rendering for styling and components
- Implement local storage as pseudo database.

## Future Plans

- Initially I considered adding an actual database, however it doesn't make sense unless I add user authentication too. I'd rather use my time to implement these features on something I'm more passionate about.
