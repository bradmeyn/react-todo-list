# React Todo
## What would a developer portfolio be without a todo list?

I wanted to start learning React, so I built this dodo list app. Initially I made it using class-based components and once I learnt about hooks I restructured the code.

- Create, edit & delete tasks.
- Deleted tasks moved to seperate completed list with completion date.
- Uses local storage as pseudo database.
